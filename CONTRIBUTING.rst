Issues
======

Bug reports, feature requests, and other contributions are welcome.
If you find a demonstrable problem that is caused by the CAP code, please:

1. Search for `already reported problems <https://github.com/cernanalysispreservation/cap-client/issues>`_.
2. Check if the issue has been fixed or is still reproducible on the latest `master` branch.
3. Create an issue, ideally with **a test case**.

Pull requests
=============

If you create a feature branch, you can run the tests to ensure that everything is operating correctly:

   ``$ ./run-tests.sh``

Each pull request should preserve or increase code coverage.

Kanban
======

We are using Kanban technique for keeping track of ongoing tasks.
Please see our `Kanban board <https://waffle.io/cernanalysispreservation/analysispreservation.cern.ch>`_ and
look for issues that are labelled as "ready for work".
