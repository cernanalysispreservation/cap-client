## Introduction

The **CAP-Client** is a command-line application for the [CERN Analysis Preservation (CAP)]({{book.CAP_BASE_URL}}) API. CAP is a tool that facilitates preservation of physics data analyses, by allowing analysts to capture and store their analysis resources. The CAP-client is a free and open source project developed at [CERN](https://home.cern).

CAP-Client is complementary to the CERN Analysis Preservation project, and it allows users to interact with their analysis workspace via the command line interface. You can find more on the related documentation:
